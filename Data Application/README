This folder contains scripts for reproducing the case studies application example:

While it does not include the data, it is available upon request.

After downloading the data, the 'Source - Clean Data.R' script can clean the data to be used in the following models.



Enamel Hypoplasia (Individual) Case Study
First, the 'EH - Full Model.R' script can be used to identify biomarkers with a posterior probability of inclusion greater than 0.6 to be selected for the reduced model. 

Then, the reduced model analysis can be reproduced with 'EH - Reduced Model.R'.




Multivariate Defects Case Study
To start, the 'Incisal - Full Model.R' script can be used to identify biomarkers with a posterior probability of inclusion greater than 0.6 to be selected for the reduced model. 

Then, the reduced model analysis can be reproduced with 'Incisal - Reduced Model.R'.
